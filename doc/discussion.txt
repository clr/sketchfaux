* need to set up an event pool to control the 'disabled' state of buttons like 'undo' and 'stop'.

* I added the latest jQuery, and am converting the prototype from XUL to HTML.

* Relying on 3rd-party lib/vendor/colorpickers for the colorpicker [ Stefan Petre, www.eyecon.ro ] and for the overall theme inspiration.

* JSON is a native object in Firefox3.5!  Yey!!  I patched the $.ajax call to use the built-in JSON object to parse the incoming text if available, which is much faster than the standard method.

* Need to give some sort of 'loading' feedback.  Maybe some sort of effect on the canvas?

* Use mbleigh's twitter-auth for User management

* cursor preview, and feedback for opacity and diameter

* save to S3

* save canvas directly to PNG?  what does the browser security model look like for this?

* thumbnails -- gather the pixels from canvas, and submit that in the 'save' post

* import background photos, from Flickr, for example?

* import directly from SketchFu URL?

* seriously in need of performance improvements

* exception handling is currently very poor -- need to check for empty string names, etc.
