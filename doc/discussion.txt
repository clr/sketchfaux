* Talked to Corey Haines about js testing yesterday, and he pointed out some magic being done with ScrewUnit combined with env.js; I'm convinced/excited; will use http://github.com/nkallen/screw-unit/tree/master for the forseeable future rather than QUnit.

* Need to set up an event pool to control the 'disabled' state of buttons like 'undo' and 'stop'.

* Relying on 3rd-party lib/vendor/colorpickers for the colorpicker [ Stefan Petre, www.eyecon.ro ] and for the overall theme inspiration.

* JSON is a native object in Firefox3.5!  Yey!!  I patched the $.ajax call to use the built-in JSON object to parse the incoming text if available, which is much faster than the standard method.

* Need to give some sort of 'loading' feedback.  Maybe some sort of effect on the canvas?

* Use mbleigh's twitter-auth for User management?

* Need some sort of cursor preview, and feedback for opacity and diameter

* Save to S3?

* Save canvas directly to PNG, download to desktop?

* To do thumbnails properly, need to create a new canvas, merge old canvas and scratch, and then scale, then send base64 of that.

* Import background photos, from Flickr, for example?

* Import directly from SketchFu URL?

* Seriously in need of performance improvements.

* Exception handling is currently very poor -- need to check for empty string names, negative tests, etc.

* Tag images and record inheritance.

* Mouse movement artifacts -- need to bind on mouseout, mousein while pen is down.
